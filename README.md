### Development Workflow

#### Creating and Managing Repositories
##### Creating a New Repository
- Create New Repository
- Choose a meaningful name and description for the project.
- Decide if the repository will be public or private.
- Initialize the repository with a README file.
- Add the SWE project template to the repository
  - > [Project Template](./projects/_template/README.md)
- Choose a license (MIT) for your project.
##### Repository Configuration
- Add some branches
  - > develop 
  - > feature 
  - > bugfix 
  - > hotfix 
  - > release 
- Set up branch protection rules to safeguard the integrity of your main branch.
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines to improve software quality and automate the development process.
- Utilize project boards to organize tasks and track progress.
#### Collaboration and Workflow
##### Issues and Project Management
- Create issues to track new ideas, tasks, or bugs.
- Use labels and milestones to categorize and prioritize issues.
  - labels:
    - > bug 
    - > feature 
    - > enhancement 
    - > documentation
    - > help!! 
    - > good_first_issue 
    - > wontfix 
    - > duplicate
  - milestones
    - > setup_project 
    - > ver_0 
    - > ver_0.1
    - > ver_0.2
    - > beta 
- Employ project boards to visually manage progress.
##### Pull Requests and Code Review
- Encourage pull requests as the standard method for code contributions.
- Conduct code reviews to ensure code quality.
- Use Draft Pull Requests for works in progress and to discuss ideas.
##### Branching Strategies
- Define a clear branching strategy (e.g., Git Flow or Feature Branch Workflow) for an organized work environment.
#### Advanced Features
##### GitHub Actions and CI/CD
Utilize GitHub Actions to automate workflows for testing, building, and deploying.
Integrate external CI/CD tools if necessary.
##### GitHub Pages
- Use GitHub Pages to host project documentation or personal blogs directly from your repositories.
##### GitHub Packages
- Use GitHub Packages to host and share your software packages.
##### Security and Code Quality
- Enable GitHubâ€™s Code Scanning and Security Alerts to identify vulnerabilities in your code.
- Integrate code quality tools and linters into your CI/CD pipelines.
#### Best Practices
##### Documentation
- Keep your README files, wikis, and code comments up-to-date to make it easier for other developers to work on your project.
